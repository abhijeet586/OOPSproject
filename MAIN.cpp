//Hope you liked our small project....
//Made by Abhijeet , Vaaman , Pratyush , Ridhi
/*We made a static website based on this for the frontend part using html,css,javascript..(We cannot run this code as a website directly as its a cpp code
so we had to make the website with same functioning as this using html,css,javascript....its basically mimicing our cpp project instead of directly
using the same as its not possible for websites to run cpp backend as browsers dont understand cpp as they dont have built in compilers,
cpp itself is a compiled programming language used for games , software tools, etc whereas web programming understands completely 
different languages like html , css , javascript , etc. ).............abort*/
